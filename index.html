	<p>Here’s a detailed paragraph highlighting the changes made to the Blue Lock website compared to the original template:
The original template, "Mustache Enthusiast," has been transformed into a vibrant Blue Lock-themed website. The title was updated to "Blue Lock," and the logo was replaced with a Blue Lock-themed image. The header's navigation menu was streamlined by removing the "blog" and "contact" links, leaving "home," "about," and "gallery" as the main navigation options. The hero section now features a Blue Lock image and a new headline, "Introducing Blue Lock," accompanied by a description inviting visitors to learn about the anime's themes of competition and growth. 
The placeholders for character images were replaced with Blue Lock characters such as Ego Jinpachi, Yoichi Isagi, and Meguru Bachira, complete with appropriate image alt texts and captions. 
Styling changes include a new blue gradient background to align with Blue Lock’s theme, updated font colors for better contrast, and redesigned elements like the hero section overlay with semi-transparent black and rounded corners for a modern aesthetic. The footer was updated to display a copyright for "Blue Lock." Additionally, a JavaScript alert was added to display a personalized "Welcome to my Blue Lock website!" message exclusively on the home page. These modifications create a tailored, engaging experience that immerses visitors in the world of Blue Lock.</p>
